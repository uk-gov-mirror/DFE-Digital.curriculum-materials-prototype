			<p>Our history curriculum allows year 7 pupils to retain powerful knowledge, with challenging opportunities to build upon prior knowledge embedded throughout. It is carefully designed and sequenced so that knowledge and vocabulary will be stored in pupilsâ€™ long-term memories.</p>
			<p>We want our history curriculum to inspire children to learn more about Geography beyond the classroom, using the knowledge and vocabulary acquired in year 7 confidently and fluently to form judgements and arguments, or to solve problems later in life.</p>
