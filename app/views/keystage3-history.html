    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Key stage 3 history</h1>

	
	    <p>Curriculum content across key stage 3 has been carefully and coherently sequenced.</p>	
		<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Chronological study</h4>
		<p>The approach at key stage 3 is broadly chronological. Key stage content has been designed with the belief that although an engaging, enquiry-based approach is pedagogically sound, this should not be at the expense of knowledge rich, chronological coherence.</p>
		<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">A study of British history and society</h4>
			<p>Particularly with reference to British history, students should have, at the end of key stage 3, an overview of many of the major events and changes that have taken place in British society over the last one thousand plus years.</p> <p>The focus is a number of themes that recur throughout key stage 3 and key stage 4, looking at change and continuity in political power, social and economic issues, religious beliefs, and scientific knowledge.</p>
			<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The study of world history</h4>
			<p>Interspersed throughout our key stage 3 study of these changes and continuities in British history, are a number of world history studies.</p> <p> A key principle in the curriculum design is that students come from a diverse range of backgrounds and that, although an overview of British history is important as this is the identity we all share, an understanding of the importance, history and contribution of other cultures is vital.</p>
			<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The ability to engage with history</h4>
			<p>Curriculum content has been designed with the belief that engagement and enthusiasm is key to student progress. The aim is to make the study of history relevant to the modern world where possible, whilst recognising the value of knowledge for its own sake. History can, in both the knowledge and skills it develops, help students make sense of what is a complex world around them.</p>
				<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Key themes and skills across key stage 3 and key stage 4</h4>
			<p>Engagement and careful exam preparation need to be kept in balance. Interleaving across both key stage 3 and key stage 4 allows key themes and skills to be returned to regularly.</p> <p>The volume of content that students need to learn at key stage 4 in history, and the importance of key stage 3 history providing a comprehensive historical education in its own right, mean that there is some return to key topics over the course of both key stages. However, the academic demands of the topic and the materials used are different between both key stages. </p> <p>Care is taken to ensure topics such as the rise of Hitler do not become stale, but instead that key stage 4 builds on what is done at key stage 3.</p>
