<h3 class='govuk-heading-l'>Understand the aims of the lesson </h3>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Objective: to learn the types of volcano</h4>

<p>By the end of the lesson, pupils should know:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>know the characteristics of different types of volcanoes, and distinguish one type from another based on its eruption style</li>
	<li>be able to locate volcanoes on a map using grid coordinates</li>
</ul>
			
<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Core knowledge for all pupils</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">By the end of the lesson, pupils should know:</p>
			
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>volcanoes occur at a destructive plate boundary</li>
        <li>a lava flow is molten rock only</li>
        <li>a pyroclastic flow is a mixture of molten rock, ash and gases</li>				
      </ul>


<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Vocabulary for this learning objective</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">By the end of the lesson, pupils should know the words:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>cone</li>
	<li>vent</li>
	<li>magma chamber</li>
	<li>dome</li>
	<li>shield</li>
	<li>strato</li>								
</ul>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Common misconceptions </h4>

<p class="govuk-body">The following misconceptions are common:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>all volcanoes erupt violently (this misconception arises from media coverage which is biased by location and death tolls)</li>
	<li>if a volcano doesn’t erupt for a hundred years, it’s extinct (in fact, the volcano is probably just dormant)</li>
	<li>volcanoes only form on land, not under water (actually, there are numerous oceanic fault lines with volcanoes forming along these without breaking the surface of the water)</li>
	<li>magma comes from deep within the Earth’s mantle (this comes from textbooks’ saying that the magma is ‘deep’ down - in reality, virtually all magma originates in the upper portion of the mantle and crust because of plate friction)</li>					
</ul>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Building on previous knowledge</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Pupils should already know the following concepts and vocabulary: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>lava: red-hot liquid rock</li>
	<li>volcano: a mountain that erupts, or has erupted</li>
	<li>volcanic eruption: an explosion or outpouring of lava, rock or as from a volcano</li>							
</ul>


<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Core knowledge for teachers</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Teachers should know:</p>

<p>		
	The impacts of volcanic eruptions are categorised into primary and
	secondary effects, as well as: social, economic, and environmental.
</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Primary effects</h5>

<p>
Direct impacts of a volcanic hazard (for example, deaths and destruction).
</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Secondary effects</h5>

<p>
	The result of another effect, usually a primary effect (for example,
	homelessness).
</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Social effects</h5>

<p>
	Effects that impact people.
<p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Economic effects</h5>
<p>
	Effects that impact the economy of a location or people’s access to income.
<p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Environmental effects</h5>
<p>
	Effects that impact the natural world (for example, nature or the
	topography of the landscape).
</p>
<p>
	The effects of a volcanic eruption can continue to develop over a series of
	days or sometimes weeks depending on the timeline and strength of the eruption.
