<h3 class='govuk-heading-l'>Understand the aims of the lesson </h3>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Lesson objective</h4>

<p>To explain why William of Normandy won the Battle of Hastings.</p>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>How the lesson structure benefits pupils' learning </h4>

<p>Students will have studied the succession crisis of 1066 and the build up to the Battle of Hastings, including an examination of the claimants to the throne, preparations for conflict and the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The purpose of this lesson is to ensure students know the reasons William was able to achieve victory, can develop them into increasingly sophisticated explanations, and understand some of the issues with evidence from this period (and historical evidence in general.) How historical factors work together, leading to a particular conclusion, is the main focus in this lesson and something students will return to consistently throughout the key stage.</p>

			
<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Core knowledge for pupils</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">By the end of the lesson, pupils should know:</p>

<p>Pupils should be able to explain the key reasons William of Normandy won the Battle of Hastings and be able to categorise those reasons. Higher attainers will be able to offer more detailed explanations of how each factor contributed to victory, whereas lower attainers may just be able to identify reasons and begin to start explaining them. Pupils should be encouraged to reflect on the nature of historical evidence, how we reach conclusions about the past, and what constitutes relevant information when addressing a specific historical question.</p>


<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Key vocabulary</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">By the end of the lesson, pupils should know the words:</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>tactics</li>
	<li>pope</li>
	<li>papal</li>
	<li>relevance</li>
	<li>strategy</li>	
	<li>feigned flight</li>										
</ul>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Common misconceptions </h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Misconceptions teachers should be aware of:</p>

<p>This lesson provides a good opportunity to address the difficulties presented by ambiguous pieces of evidence, such as the section of the Bayeux tapestry that appears to show Harold Godwinson being killed with an arrow to the eye. Teachers can refer to the slide that shows this section of the story and show students that it isn’t actually clear who is being hit with the arrow. Lots of students will have heard this story as historical fact and this is a chance to demonstrate how evidence relating to historical events can be interpreted in different ways.</p>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Building on previous knowledge</h4>

<p>Vocabulary and concepts pupils should already be aware of:</p>

<p>Most of the vocabulary in this lesson should be familiar to students from previous lessons where they have studied the build up to the battle of Hastings.</p>

<h4 class='govuk-heading-m'>Core knowledge for teachers</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">There is an episode of the documentary series ‘Battlefield Britain’ presented by Dan Snow that covers the Battle of Hastings and preceding months in detail, with a focus on battlefield tactics. </p>
