          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Medieval realms</h2>
        <p>The unit is intended to provide a firm foundation for the rest of key stage 3 history where students will return repeatedly to key themes and skills.</p>
				

				  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How this lesson sequence benefits pupils' learning</h3>
				<p>The medieval realms unit weaves together key knowledge, skills and understanding required throughout key stage 3 history.</p> <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The ability to recognise fundamental themes</h4><p>There is a broadly chronological approach to the period, but within this there are two key fundamental themes: political power (the Norman conquest, Feudalism, conflict between church and crown, the Magna Carta and the Peasants' Revolt) and religion, beliefs and attitudes (the Catholic church, the importance of religion in daily life, Thomas Becket, the Crusades and the Black Death).</p>
			  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Examination and analysis of ordinary life</h4>
				
				<p>Schools may also opt, if they have the time, to undertake an examination of life for ordinary people through a focus on medieval towns and villages as well as crime and punishment.</p>	
			  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The development of key historical skills</h4>
				
				<p>The unit also offers a focus on a range of key historical skills. Students develop their understanding of causation in history through their study of the Battle of Hastings, Thomas Becket, Magna Carta and the Peasants' Revolt, whilst their examination of the importance of religion uses primary sources to draw conclusions.</p><p> Interpretations of history are addressed primarily via their study of King Richard and King John, and accounts of the death of Wat Tyler.</p>
