				<p>Access curriculum resources is a service for teachers. It enables them to access their school’s curriculum online, including all the lesson plans, resources, and subject knowledge they will need to teach it. </p>

				<p>The Department for Education has collaborated with educational experts and cultural institutions to create a  service that aims to reduce teacher workloads and enhance the quality of teaching in schools, with all teaching materials available to download or print from the service. </p>

				<p>Curriculum content has been sequenced so that the knowledge and vocabulary pupils gain at school can be retained and applied later in life. </p>
